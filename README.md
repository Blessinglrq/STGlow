## Installation
### Dependencies
 - Python 3.8
 - pytorch 1.11.0
 - cuda 11.3
 - Ubuntu 20.04
 - RTX 3090
 - Please refer to the "requirements.txt" file for more details.

## Training
Users can train the STGlow models on ETH/UCY or SDD dataset easily by runing the following command:

For ETH/UCY:
```
python tools/train_for_eth_ucy.py 
```

For SDD:
```
python tools/train_for_sdd.py 
```

## Inference 
Users can test the STGlow models on ETH/UCY or SDD dataset easily by runing the following command:

For ETH/UCY:
```
python tools/test_for_eth_ucy.py 
```

For SDD:
```
python tools/test_for_sdd.py 
```

Note that our project is developed based on the [code](https://github.com/umautobots/bidireaction-trajectory-prediction) of [BiTraP: Bi-directional Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Multi-modal Goal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14558).
